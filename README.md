# Chalk-rs
a simple port of the library "chalk.js" to Rust

Chalk.rs
Chalk.rs is a Rust library that provides a simple and flexible way to style text in the terminal. Whether you're building command-line applications, making scripts more colorful, or simply want to enhance your terminal output, Chalk.rs lets you easily apply text styles and colors.

Features
Colors: Apply colors to your text, including Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, and White.

Text Styles: Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Overline, and Inverse for various text effects.

Easy-to-Use API: Chain methods for styling text (e.g., chalk.red("Hello").bold().underline().display()).

Cross-Platform: Works across different platforms that support ANSI escape codes (Linux, macOS, and Windows with appropriate terminal support).

Installation
To add Chalk.rs to your project, add it to your Cargo.toml dependencies:

toml

Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use Chalk.rs in your Rust application:

```rust
use chalk::Chalk;

fn main() {
    let chalk = Chalk::new();
    chalk.red("Hello, world!").bold().underline().display();
}
```

Available Styles and Colors
